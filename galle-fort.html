                    Galle Fort is by far the most important tourist attraction in Galle. 
                    Spread over a humongous area of 36 acres, the fort is a settlement in
                    itself which showcases the century-old culture and colonial heritage of Galle.
                    Galle is a coastal city 130 kilometres south of Colombo. There are two main areas 
                    to visit in Galle: the Galle Fort and Unawatuna. No visit to the south is complete
                    without seeing both of these areas. A perfect combination of beach and culture,
                    Galle has it all.

                <div id="pt2">
                    Galle’s earliest historical existence is traced to Ptolemy’s world map of 125–150 CE when it was a busy port, trading with Greece, Arab countries, China and others.
                    Its mention as a "port of call of the Levant" is made in the cosmography of Cosmas Indicopleustes. 
                    This is the harbour where the Portuguese, under the leadership of Lourenço de Almeida, made their first landing in 1505 on the island and caused a notable change in developments on the island with their close friendship with Dharmaparakrama Bahu (1484–1514), the then king of the country.
                    Before the Portuguese arrived here, Ibn Batuta had touched base at this port.
                    This was the beginning of the fort’s history, which was built by the Portuguese, along with a Franciscan chapel (now mostly in ruins) inside the fort in 1541. 
                    The fort also, in later years, served as prison camp to incarcerate Sinhalese natives who opposed the Portuguese.
                    The Portuguese had moved to Colombo from Galle as they preferred the latter. In 1588, however, they were attacked by the Sinhalese King Raja Singha I (1581–93) of Sitawaka, which forced the Portuguese to return to Galle.
                    At Galle, they initially built a small fort out of palm trees and mud. They called it the Santa Cruz, and later extended it with a watch tower and three bastions and a "fortalice" to guard the harbour.

                    In 1640, the events took a turn with the Dutch entering the fray joining hands with King Rajasinhe II to capture the Galle Fort.
                    The Dutch, with a force of some 2,500 men under Koster, captured the fort from the Portuguese in 1640 itself.
                    Although not an ideal situation for the Sinhalese, they were instrumental in building the fort as seen in its present form
                    in the Dutch architectural style. Fortifications were added up to the early 18th century. The establishment consisted of public 
                    administration buildings, warehouses and business houses and residential quarters. A Protestant church (planned by Abraham Anthonisz) 
                    was also built in baroque style in 1775 to cater to the colonists and the local people who were converted to Christianity. The most prominent 
                    buildings in the fort complex were the Commandant's residence, the arsenal and the gun house. Other buildings erected in the fort catered 
                    to trade and defense requirements such as workshops for carpentry, smithy, rope making and so forth. They also built an elaborate system 
                    of sewers that were flooded at high tide, taking the sewage away to sea.
